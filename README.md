## hey everyoneðŸ‘‹
My name is ByteBreakerGhost, and my real name is Maulana Yasyfa'u Al Azhiim Yudho Leksono. I am a student who is interested in the digital world.  

I am still a beginner, which is why I want to delve deeper into programming languages, especially the Python programming language, as I want to focus on Python first.  

After that, I want to learn other programming languages like HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and others.
