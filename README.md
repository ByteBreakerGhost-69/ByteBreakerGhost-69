# üí´ About Me:
 üëã About Me<br><br>hello everyone!  <br><br>My full name is **Maulana Yasyfa'u Al-Azhiim Yudho Leksono**,  but I‚Äôm more known online as **ByteBreakerGhost-69**.  <br>I come from **Kediri, East Java, Indonesia**,  and I am currently on a journey to become a self-taught **beginner programmer**  <br>with a strong interest in **Python programming**, **cybersecurity**, and **bug bounty hunting**.  <br>I truly believe that anyone can learn and grow from anywhere,  as long as they have the will and the spirit to keep going.  <br>I use this GitHub account as an open space to learn,  document personal projects, and share things I‚Äôve learned along the way.<br><br>My journey started when I first discovered the world of **coding**  through online resources like YouTube, official docs, and GitHub itself.  <br>I found it fascinating because coding is not only about logic,  but also a medium for emotional expression.  <br>One time, I created a text animation project just to pour out my feelings.  That‚Äôs why I feel programming has a deeply personal side too.  <br>I hope that someday, I can build software that benefits many people,  especially in the field of digital safety and social solutions.  <br>I know the road is long, but with hard work, community support,  and my parents‚Äô prayers, I believe everything is possible.<br><br>Right now, I‚Äôm focusing on mastering the **Python language**,  starting from the basics, building small creative projects,  <br>and trying out text animations and simple automation tools.  I‚Äôm also exploring the world of **cybersecurity** from the ground up,  <br>using distros like Kali Linux and BlackArch to experiment.  I want to understand how systems can be breached,  <br>and more importantly‚Äîhow to protect them.  I believe that good hackers are those who think like attackers  <br>but act ethically to defend and help others.  Bug bounty hunting is a field I see as both a challenge and opportunity.<br><br>Even though I‚Äôm still a beginner, I‚Äôm fully committed to daily learning.  I value documentation, collaboration, and feedback.  <br>This GitHub is my open practice ground,  a place to keep my progress and experiments visible.  <br>I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit my current limitations,  because I know every skilled coder was once a beginner.  <br>I also love seeing my growth through commits and project versions  as I slowly improve my logic and structure.  <br>With enough practice and patience,  I hope to build a strong foundation in the IT world.<br><br>I‚Äôm open to collaboration and mentorship from anyone.  If you have a small project or creative idea to work on together,  <br>feel free to reach out to me!  I‚Äôm eager to learn from others, and contribute what I can  <br>to open-source or community-based projects.  I‚Äôm learning how to write cleaner code, read documentation better,  <br>and manage my study time more effectively.  I believe that learning together is more fun  <br>and helps everyone grow faster.  Feel free to contact me via GitHub, email, or social media.<br><br>Aside from Python and cybersecurity, I‚Äôm also interested in many things.  I enjoy working on projects that tell stories behind the code.  <br>I like combining technology with art, such as poetic lines in animations.  In the future, I want to learn more programming languages like JavaScript  <br>to build interactive websites and engaging visualizations.  I also want to dive into AI and machine learning one day,  <br>to understand how tech can help humans in real life.  I know it‚Äôll take time and effort, but I‚Äôm excited about the journey.  <br>Technology is an endless world full of creativity and challenge.  There‚Äôs always something new to explore and build.<br><br>Lastly, I want to turn this GitHub into my digital journal.  A place where I can be honest, expressive, make mistakes, and improve.  <br>I hope to inspire those who feel insecure about being beginners‚Äî  that it‚Äôs okay to start from zero, and there‚Äôs no shame in that.  <br>Success doesn‚Äôt belong to the smartest people,  but to those who never give up and keep trying.  <br>If you‚Äôre starting out too, let‚Äôs grow and learn together.  If you‚Äôre already skilled, please help guide us who are learning.  <br>Because sharing doesn‚Äôt take away from you, it multiplies your value.  <br>Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile.
