# maulana yasyfa'u al azhiim yudho leksono -- ByteBreakerGhost

## hey everyone👋
   
my real name is maulana yasyfa'u al azhiim yudho leksono You can call me Yasyfa'u or Maulana! I’m a passionate beginner programmer diving into the vast universe of IT, with a current obsession for Python. Why Python? Its simplicity and power—from scripting to AI—make it the perfect launchpad for my coding journey. Right now, I’m grinding through fundamentals, solving problems on platforms like LeetCode, and building small projects (check my repos!). My mantra: *“Learn, build, repeat.”*  

## 🌐 Beyond Python: Expanding My Stack 
While Python is my first love, I’m already eyeing the **front-end trio (HTML, CSS, JS)** to craft sleek websites. Future goals? Mastering Django/Flask for back-end magic and React for dynamic UIs. I also go by @ByteBreakerGhost on socials—follow me for chaotic coding snippets, memes, and progress updates! Collaboration fuels me, so if you’re into hackathons or open-source, ping me. Let’s turn bugs into features together.  

## 🚀 More Than Just Code 
When I’m not debugging, you’ll find me binge-watching tech tutorials, obsessing over cybersecurity docs, or gaming (low-key a Valorant strategist). I’m all about community learning — hit me up for geeky chats, mentorship, or just to share your favorite dev tools. Ready to connect? Drop a message or find me as @ByteBreakerGhost across platforms. *“Coding is poetry; let’s write some verses.”*
